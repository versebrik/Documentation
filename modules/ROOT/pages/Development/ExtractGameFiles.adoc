Having access to the model and texture files used by Coffee Stain
can be a valuable resource for creating content for your own mods.
This page contains instructions on how to view and extract various game assets.

As a reminder, redistributing these assets should not be done without permission,
as they are copyrighted content of Coffee Stain Studios.

[TIP]
====
If you're just looking to re-use the exact
same icon, mesh etc. as something in the base game for your mod,
you should check out the
xref:Development/ReuseGameFiles.adoc[Reusing Game Files page] instead.

== Extracting Specific Models or Textures

[TIP]
====
If you're looking to use parts of base game machines such as item
and fluid ports, power connectors, or more, consider taking a look at
xref:CommunityResources/ModelingTools.adoc[AngryBeaver's ModelingTools].
====

The tool https://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel[UModel]
can be used to view game pak file content,
and offers options for exporting meshes, skeletons, textures, etc. for use in other programs.
Tutorials for using UModel are plentiful online,
and a quick search can help you export for the modeling software of your choice.

Make sure to select Unreal Engine version 4.26 when opening Satisfactory pak files.

If you don't see 4.26 as an option, you are running an older version of UModel
and you should download it again from the link above.

You can find a brief tutorial on how to track down an asset for export on the
xref:Development/ReuseGameFiles.adoc#_example_static_mesh_reuse[Reusing Game Files page].

Once you have found the asset you want to export, open it in UModel's UE Viewer
and use `Tools` -> `Export Current Object` and you will be presented with
some options for export.
We suggest exporting as Static Meshes as `glTF 2.0`
so that software such as Blender can open them easily.

Note that not all of the content you can extract in this manner is directly useful.
For example, directly exporting an `FGItemDescriptor` is not really helpful.

== Extracting Sounds/Music

Because Satisfactory uses the Wwise sound system,
extracting game sound files is a different process compared to many other Unreal Engine games. 

Thankfully, GitHub user AyrA has created a tool that can extract some of the game's sound files from the pak for you.
You can either
https://cable.ayra.ch/satisfactory/editor[download the save editor the tool is bundled with]
to get the audio files yourself, or
https://cable.ayra.ch/satisfactory/satsound/[play and export the sounds directly from your web browser].

== Generating a Complete Starter Project

The Starter Project provided on the SML releases page excludes
game models, textures, etc. for copyright and download size reasons.
In their place, the Starter Project includes empty "placeholder" assets
that, at runtime, will be resolved into the correct assets if you were to reference them,
or simply excludes the asset from the project (which is the case for many textures).

It is possible to create a personal version of the Starter Project
that includes most of these base game files accessible from within the editor.
This version of the project would include models, textures, and other resources
instead of their placeholder versions, allowing you to view them in-editor.

Generating this special project file takes a significant amount of time and additional disk space.
If you'd like to do this, check out the page on the
xref:CommunityResources/AssetToolkit.adoc[Asset Toolkit].
